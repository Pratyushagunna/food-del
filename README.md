I created 3 main things , The frontend part for user , frontend part for admin and server for the backend ,
I used render for deploying all these , You can click on this link to view the live demo of my food del website

As of now the admins login is set as default , You can view all the orders requested by all the users , 
Later I will add admins to login so more number of restaurant can add their items and accept their order individually.
